# Nash Framework

The Nash Framework is an early-stage application engine, designed primarily for the development of server-side CLI applications. Currently, little features have been implemented.

## Getting started with Nash

Nash can be used on any platform, with most IDEs. Generally, it is aimed towards support with common IDEs, like Visual Studio, CodeLite, CodeBlocks, and more.

**Downloading the required files**
To download the needed files to work with Nash, start by cloning the repository into your working directory. You can do this with `git clone https://github.com/LukeChemeriov/Nash`.

## The Plan for Nash

The plan for Nash, is mostly to create both an independent, open-source server-side development framwork, but also to have a simple, intuitive UI, allowing new and/or inexperienced programmers to pick up using the framwork easily.
